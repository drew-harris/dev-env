Your job is to help me transfer parts of my old neovim config to my new neovim config. The old config is located in ./nvim
 and the new config is located in ./new-nvim/

I am going to tell you something to move over and I want you to find everywhere it is referenced in the old config and implement it in the new config. Make sure that you align the implemtation with the new organization style of the new config. Don't just copy files over. Really make sure that you implement it in a clean way.
